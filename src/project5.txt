1. There are two events in our world that are triggered by clicking the world. The first event is triggered by clicking \
a block within the rocks background. The second event is triggered by clicking a block in the ocean background.

2. When the first event (clicking the rocks) is triggered, the background is changed to lighter rocks and a portal
entity that takes up 2 x 2 blocks is summoned. Regular dragons up to four blocks away are transformed into the mobile
toothless entity. Six different dragon hunters are spawned.
When the second event (clicking the ocean) is triggered, the background is changed to a darker, poisoned ocean and a ship
entity that takes up 3 x 4 blocks is summoned. Regular dragons up to seven blocks away are transformed into the mobile
lightFury entity. Four different dragonHunterLeader entities are spawned.

3. The affected entities, the dragons, do different things depending on what new entity they were transformed into. The
mobile toothless entity goes around eating (deleting) dragonHunter entities. Once it has eaten one dragonHunter it
returns to the water similar to how the dudes returned to the house when full, and then after that it resumes activity.
The mobile lightFury entity goes around eating or deleting dragonHunterLeader entities, and also returns to the water
after eating one dragonHunterLeader.

4. The new entity is the dragonHunterLeader who goes around capturing dragons in egg form. Once it captures and egg
and removes it from the world, this entity returns to the ship. It then repeats the cycle until there are no eggs or it
gets eaten by a lightFury.
