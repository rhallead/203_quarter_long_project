I kept the math methods in the Functions class because multiple classes 
        move them and they didn't particularly fit into a specific class.
        
I kept the parse/process/load methods in the Functions class 
        because they are not directly related to WorldModel since its reading in from a file.
        
All the reasons for adding the methods I picked into the entity class is because that 
        method depended on the Entity the most. It used the Entity instance 
        variables the most and it made the most sense to put it there.
        For example, I moved getCurrentImage() and getAnimationPeriod() because those
        were highly dependent on the Entity being passed into the class. So putting it in 
        the Entity class made the most sense.
        
I moved the draw functions into WorldView because those are drawing things into the whole
        world and not just viewport. Also the main Paramater being used was the Worldview parameter
        
I moved a lot of functions into WorldModel because they were setting up how the world looked or they 
        were moving something around in the world. These all belong in WorldModel because this class keep track
        of what the world looks like and sets everything up. On top of that, I put findNearest into WorldModel
        for similar reasons. This method was the hardest for me to move because there felt like there was no 
        correct answer. But in terms of the future, WorldModel seemed like the best fit.

The methods I moved to Action and Event seemed relatively obvious because of the parameters.

I kept nearestEntity and getImages in Functions because those are accessed between multiple different classes 
        so keeping them in Functions made the most sense because there was no true answer based on parameters either.
